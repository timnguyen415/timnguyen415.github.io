            <p><ul>
                <li>Video Games:<ul>
                    <li>Likes several genres except horror (physically incapable of playing/watching horror games) and racing (bores me)</li>
                    <li>"I'm a PC", but I do not agree with "PCMASTERRACE"; I like all platforms of gaming.</li>
                    <li>Most commonly found playing "League of Legends", "Hearthstone", or "FTL: Faster Than Light"</li>
                    <li>I have a Youtube Channel as a documentation of me playing games. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/silentshadow415">HERE</a> to visit.</li>
                    <li>The Youtube Channel has two policies:<ul>
                        <li>Recommended Games will be looked into for consideration. If several people recommend the same game, I will make a video of me playing that game.</li>
                        <li>Games Gifted (physical or electronic copies) will have at least one video of me playing it.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul></p>
