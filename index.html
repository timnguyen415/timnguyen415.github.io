      <h1>Tim's Homepage</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my Homepage!</p>
      <hr>
      
      <h1>Objective</h1>
      <p>To define myself in the world as a software developer until further notice.</p>
      
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>"It's not about the gift you give, it's about the generosity that the recipient will remember."</p>
      
      <h2>Profitable Attributes:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm flexible in methods of performance (i.e. I have different ways to perform the same task, and I can learn other options quickly).</li>
        <li>Regardless of the time frame I am given, I perform all of my tasks to the best of my ability.</li>
        <li>I'll make sure that the task I am given is completed, whether I have to finish it to completion myself or get help when needed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Selective Attributes:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm easily distracted and often called "lazy". I simply take breaks so that I can calm my mind and return to the task at hand with a refreshed mind such that I can perform the activity with better quality.</li>
        <li>I procrastinate a lot. The upside to this is that when I begin or continue to work on the assignment, I find the quickest and most accurate method to completing my task to be able to finish on time.</li>
        <li>I have a fairly short memory. Often, I'll have to be reminded to do something, but the things I do remember doesn't ever leave my head.</li>
        <li>I'm a quiet person and tend to focus primarily on my own tasks. As such, this allows me to finish my assignments with little requested distraction.</li>
      </ul>
